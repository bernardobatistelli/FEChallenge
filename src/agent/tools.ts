/**
 * The copilot's tool catalog — what the agent can actually do.
 *
 * Each tool is a THIN, declarative wrapper over one scoped query fn in
 * `@/db/analytics`. Boundary rule: this file imports from `@/db/analytics`
 * only — never `@/db/client` (`db`), never raw SQL — so no tool can express an
 * unscoped or PII-leaking query. Tenant scope and PII gating live one layer
 * down (`scopeWhere` + `candidateSelection`), enforced by construction.
 *
 * The agent picks tools and passes high-level params — it never writes SQL.
 * Inputs are OPTIONAL (the mock model calls with `{}`) and use `z.enum` so the
 * valid values are both documented for the model and validated. Each tool
 * returns `{ rows, display }` (see src/agent/artifact.ts), or `{ error }` if the
 * query throws — the model reads that and tells the user the data couldn't be
 * retrieved (per the system prompt's failure rule + run.ts `onError`).
